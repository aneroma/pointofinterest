I have created a node.js web application using the Hapi framework. The web app will allow a user to crate an account, login, enter a point of interest  which are made up of a name, description, location(lat, lon), categories, and an array of images. Name, description, location, and categories can be updated. Multiple images can be added.
Users will be able to view all points of interest which will display, point of interest type, name, description and the name of the user who uploaded the information.

There is a user dashboard where they can view their POIs and a general POI board where they can view points of interest from all users. The users can also add their own custom categories for points of interest. There is also a user settings page where they can update their details.
There is an admin dashboard where the administrator can view all users, delete users, add points of interest. Admins can also update any POI.

Allows user to login or create an account if one does not exist
Add point of interest
